This program predicts a breast cancer diagnosis using a KD-Tree data structure as well as a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The model is trained by the data brovided by the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. It gives a predication of whether a diagnosis is Benign "B" or Malignant "M" by finding the 3 Nearest neighbors to the point of interest. The program includes an accuracy model that shows how accuruate the model is. For different sizes of "N" (Size of data), it consistently has an accuracy of over 85%
